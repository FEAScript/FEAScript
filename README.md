## How to Use

FEAScript is built entirely in pure JavaScript, requiring only an HTML page to run. Simulation inputs are provided as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp" target="_blank">JSON</a> files, which can be stored locally or hosted online using platforms like <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> or <a href="https://www.jsonkeeper.com/" target="_blank">JSON Keeper</a>. FEAScript operates entirely within your browser, with no reliance on cloud services.
