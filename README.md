## FEAScript

<a href="https://feascript.com/" target="_blank">FEAScript</a> is an open-source JavaScript library for solving differential equations using the finite element method. It allows you to create and run browser-based simulations of physics and engineering problems.

</br>
ðŸš§ FEAScript is in early development, and new features and improvements are constantly being added ðŸš§

## How to Use

FEAScript is written in pure JavaScript, so it only requires an HTML page to run. The simulation inputs are passed as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp" target="_blank">JSON</a> files that can be stored locally or hosted online (e.g., using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> or other services dedicated to JSON file hosting like <a href="https://www.jsonkeeper.com/" target="_blank">JSON Keeper</a>). FEAScript runs locally on your browser - no cloud services are involved. There are several examples of using FEAScript to solve various problems <a href="https://github.com/FEAScript/FEAScript/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">here</a>.
