## Heat Conduction in a Two-Dimensional Fin

This example demonstrates solving a steady-state heat transfer problem in a 2D rectangular domain using the **FEAScript** library. The problem represents a typical cooling fin scenario, where the objective is to model heat conduction and understand temperature distribution under specific boundary conditions.

### Instructions

The **mesh configuration** and **boundary conditions** are defined directly in the JavaScript section of the HTML file. For a step-by-step guide and additional details, refer to the corresponding [tutorial](https://feascript.com/tutorials/HeatConduction2DFin.html).
